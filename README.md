## Project name: ##
Geological Project - TensorFlow for interpretating satellite imagery

#### Description: ####
This is a repository for a semester course on using TensorFlow for image recognition of satellite imagery.  

### Project overview: ###

#### February 2018: ####
--------------------------------------------------------------
- [x] Project startup approved
- [x] Basic TensorFlow tutorials completed
- [x] Progress documented in /files/process.docx

#### March 2018: ####
--------------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] TensorFlow succesfully operational with GPU Support:
  - [x] OS: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
  - [x] Python: 3.5
  - [x] Handler: Anaconda Navigator 4.5.0
      <details>
       <summary>Installation</summary>
       <p>Ananconda Navigator was downloaded from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux">their website</a> and    thereafter updated to version 4.5.0 by using the navigator automatic updating platform. Then I proceeded to create a new  python environment in the Anaconda directory, to install TensorFlow into. This was done by the using the command "conda create -n tensorflow pip python=3.6"  </p>
